- Cool plugin to "manually" edit your ggplots directly from Rstudio: https://github.com/calligross/ggthemeassist

-   You can install it the same way than an R package
-   This is how it works: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calligross/ggthemeassist/master/examples/ggThemeAssist2.gif

- Also, this package allows you to obtain 'publication ready plots' and it's built on top of ggplot2: http://www.sthda.com/english/rpkgs/ggpubr/ **Cool feature**: if you have 2 or more groups that you are comparing and plotting (i.e. with boxpots, violin plots, etc) this includes a built-in function to do the statistics between the groups (for instance t-tests) and add the lines and significance values to the plot: http://www.sthda.com/english/rpkgs/ggpubr/reference/stat_compare_means.html
